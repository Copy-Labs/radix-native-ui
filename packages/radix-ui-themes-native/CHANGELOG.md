## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-22

### Changed
- Repositioned the library as "inspired by Radix Themes" rather than a port, clarifying that component APIs are native-first while the theme system and design tokens remain compatible with web Radix Themes.
- Unified all documentation and package references to the canonical package name `radix-native-ui`. The previously documented `@radix-ui/themes-native` was never published to npm and broke installation for new users.
- Fixed root `build:pkg` / `build:radix-native` scripts which filtered on a non-existent package name; they now target `packages/radix-ui-themes-native` directly.

### Fixed
- Restored the Jest test pipeline, which had been unable to run: renamed `jest.config.js` to `jest.config.cjs` (package is ESM), fixed `transformIgnorePatterns` for the pnpm `.pnpm/` store layout, added `babel.config.cjs` with `@react-native/babel-preset` (pinned to match RN 0.73), removed stale module mocks, and corrected the `useTheme` suite's filename (`.tsx`), imports, and assertions. All 10 tests now pass.

### Added
- `BottomSheet` and `Toast` documented in the overlays component lists (READMEs).
- Migration note clarifying the inspired-by positioning and native-only components.
